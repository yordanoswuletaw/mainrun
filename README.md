## Why Mainrun?

Mainrun is [Maincode's](https://maincode.com) standardized assessment framework for evaluating machine learning engineering expertise, specifically focused on LLM training and optimization. This project provides a consistent, real-world environment to explore a candidate's knowledge of:

- Transformer architectures and training dynamics
- Performance optimization techniques
- Code quality and engineering practices
- Problem-solving approaches to ML challenges
- Areas of personal interest and expertise in ML optimization

## The Challenge
Your task is to analyze and improve the training run of a small GPT-2 style model. The code is designed to train on a Hacker News headline dataset.

Your goal is to minimize the validation loss as low as possible within 7 epochs. The baseline to beat is a validation loss of 1.754.

### The Rules
The rules are simple:

- You cannot change the number of epochs, the random seed, the dataset, or the validation fraction.
- You cannot change the `evaluate()` function.
- Everything else is fair game! You can change the model architecture, initialization, tokenization, hyperparameters, optimizer, scheduler, training loop, etc.

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository and open it in VS Code
git clone <your-assessment-repo-url>
cd mainrun
code .

# 2. When prompted, reopen the project in the Dev Container
# This initial build may take a few minutes.

# 3. Run the baseline training to see the starting point
task train

# 4. Analyze the baseline performance in the log file
cat mainrun/logs/baseline.log

# 5. Start optimizing!
```

## Key Commands
You will only need two main commands for this assessment:

- `task train`: The primary command. It first runs a checkpoint and then executes the full training pipeline in train.py. You have complete freedom to refactor or extend the code, but all functionality must be accessible through this single script.
- `task submit`: When you are ready, this command will create a final checkpoint, zip up your entire repository (including all code and logs), and upload it to Maincode's evaluation system for review.

## Evaluation
Submissions will be evaluated on:

1. **Model Performance**: Most importantly, the improvement in validation loss compared to the baseline.
2. **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
3. **Innovation**: Creative or insightful approaches to optimization.
4. **Documentation**: A short report.pdf that walks through the changes you made, your reasoning, and their effect on the training curves.
